  "body": "Bathed in the spectral pallor of their flickering lanterns, the terrified boys huddled together in the decaying parlor. Merry's warning still hung heavily in the air, the lingering silence broken only by the eerie creaking of wooden beams above. 'We won\u2019t be alive if we stay,' Sam muttered. There was a certain terror in his eyes, a dread anticipation of something ominous.\n\nSuddenly, the house seemed to tremble, shivering under the weight of long-forgotten memories. An unearthly wail pierced the silence, making their blood turn cold. The walls buckled and heaved, as if the house itself was gasping for breath. 'This house is alive,' whispered Pippin, his face white as a sheet.\n\nA shrill screeching noise echoed through the labyrinthine corridors. Pippin, shivering uncontrollably, whimpered, 'I don't think we're the only one here.' Merry, though visibly shaken, rallied enough courage to answer, 'We need to stick together and find a way out.'\n\nThey ventured cautiously, their hearts pounding wildly in their chests. A sense of trepidation clung to the dank, musty air. Merry, taking the lead, stumbled upon an ornate wooden door. He turned the cold brass knob, revealing a grand staircase spiraling downward. 'This,' Merry said, gesturing towards the staircase, 'might be our way out.'\n\nOne by one, they descended the winding steps, their flickering lanterns casting long, dancing shadows on the cold stone walls. Suddenly, a spectral figure materialized at the foot of the staircase. With a bloodcurdling shriek, it lunged at them. Frozen in terror, the boys could only watch as the ghastly figure snatched Merry, dragging him into the abyss.\n\nWith renewed urgency, the remaining boys dashed through the labyrinthine corridors of the haunted house, their breaths coming out in ragged gasps. The house seemed to take on a life of its own, the walls groaning and creaking, as if mourning the loss of a prisoner.\n\nEventually, they stumbled upon what appeared to be the main entrance. With adrenaline fueling their movements, they lunged at the door. Just as they were about to taste freedom, an ethereal green hand emerged from the wall, grabbing Sam and pulling him back into the depths of the house.\n\nFrodo and Pippin barely made it out, their hearts pounding like a drum. 'We must get help,' an out-of-breath Frodo managed to exclaim. As they turned to rush away, Pippin was suddenly yanked backwards, a spectral hand claiming its final prize.\n\nFrodo ran, the cold night air biting his face. He didn't stop until he reached the safety of the town, his friends' terrified screams still echoing in his ears. Alone now, the true magnitude of the situation hit him. Only he had escaped the house alive. His friends were gone, taken by a force beyond their understanding.\n\nAs dawn broke, Frodo, traumatized and exhausted, silently vowed to himself. He would go back to the haunted house, not as a curious child, but as a determined avenger. He owed it to his friends. As the rest of the town stirred awake, a chilling realization dawned on Frodo \u2013 he would have to face the spectral presence once again.",
