  "body": "The icy breath of the forgotten memories that filled the Arlington House ruffled Frodo's hair, sending shivers down his spine. Around him, the narrow beams of their humble lanterns struggled against the oppressive darkness. The eerie silence of the house was only broken by their shallow breathings and the occasional distant creaks that echoed ominously through the shadowy halls.\n\n'Something doesn't feel right,' murmured Sam, eyes wide with terror. 'The house, it's...it's not right.' His voice broke off in a choked whisper as the air around them suddenly grew thicker, heavier.\n\n'Guys, I think...' Pippin started, but his words were drowned immediately by a deafening crash from the floor above. An instant of stunned silence was swiftly replaced by chaos. Their hearts pounded like war drums in their chests as the house roared to life around them.\n\n'RUN!' Frodo found his voice first, his call to retreat barely audible above the cacophony. They turned and fled, their lanterns casting long, distorted shadows on the decrepit walls. But the house was not willing to let go. The once-familiar rooms contorted into foreign labyrinths, doors vanished, and grotesque faces started to materialize on the ancient wallpaper.\n\nSam was the first to go, a blood-curdling scream echoing through the halls as a shadowy hand reached out from the wall, pulling him into the eerie depths. Merry was next, a sudden gust of wind sweeping him off his feet, disappearing him into icy oblivion. Finally, Pippin, with one last terrified look at Frodo, was swallowed by a sudden sinkhole that opened beneath him.\n\nFrodo, alone now, stumbled through the haunted maze in desperate pursuit of an escape. His breath came in ragged gasps, his heart hammering against his ribcage. As he rounded a corner, a faint glimmer of moonlight slipped in through a crack in the ceiling, illuminating a door - a way out! Frodo gathered his last strength, lunging towards the door, pushing it open with all his might.\n\nHe tumbled out into the open, the cool night air washing over him. He lay there, gasping desperately for breath, the adrenaline pumping through his veins slowly making room for unadulterated relief. He was alive, but the victory tasted bitter. His friends, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, they were left behind. The haunted house on Arlington Road had claimed them, and all Frodo could do was watch in helpless horror.\n\nAs the final rays of the moon shone on Frodo's tear-streaked face, the house seemed to give a satisfied shudder before everything around him fell eerily silent. The haunted house was sated, its thirst for souls quenched. Only Frodo got out alive. But at what cost?",
