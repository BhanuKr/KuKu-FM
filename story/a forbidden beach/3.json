  "body": "Our sleep was cut short by the rustling of leaves. I woke up first and saw the same figure we saw earlier, hovering at the edge of the forest. It was barely visible, like a shadow illuminated against the moonlit sky. Its vague outline and indistinct features were all we could see. 'Saumy...wake up,' I whispered, shaking her gently. She stirred, blinking sleepily at me before her eyes widened in realization. \n\nWe silently followed the figure that led us into the depths of the forest. The scenery around us changed drastically; vegetation became denser, enormous trees towering high above us, their tops completely obscured by the darkness. The air was filled with a strange, sweet, yet slightly pungent scent. We watched as the figure finally came to a halt in front of a cave lined with gleaming crystals of various colors. \n\n'Stay close,' I murmured to Saumy as we ventured further. The figure turned towards us, its undefined features forming a semblance of a face, and then it spoke. Its voice echoed through the cave, soft yet commanding, its words filled with wisdom from ages past. 'Welcome, Saumy and Karan. We\u2019ve been expecting you.' \n\nOur hearts pounded in our chests. 'Who are you?' Saumy finally asked, her voice echoing our shared confusion. \n\nThe figure let out a sound, something between a chuckle and sigh. 'I am the Guardian of this beach. And you two are chosen to defend it from the upcoming danger.' We looked at each other in disbelief. Chosen? To defend a beach? From what threat? \n\nBefore we could voice our confusion and disbelief, the figure explained, 'Once in every thousand years, the Sea Serpent wakes up, and if not controlled, it will cause havoc. That's why we need you two \u2013 the descendants of the ancient protectors.' \n\nThe words hit us like a sledgehammer. We were just ordinary adventure enthusiasts, not protectors of mythical creatures. But as we stood there listening to the Guardian, a sense of duty, a surge of adrenaline, and maybe even a bit of excitement washed over us. We looked at each other, nodded, and turned back to the Guardian. 'What do we need to do?' I asked. \n\nWith those words, the Guardian started instructing us. There was little time left before the Sea Serpent would awaken. As the figure faded, leaving us with our new responsibilities, a chilling wind swept the beach. We knew that our lives would never be the same. This was not just another adventure; it was a mission, a destiny that was thrust upon us, and we had no choice but to accept it. As the Guardian disappeared, the cave was plunged into darkness once again. Suddenly, a low rumble echoed through the forest. Something was stirring in the deep.\n\nThis was just the beginning.",

We\u2019d hiked through the Amazon, bungee jumped in New Zealand, and even survived an avalanche in the Swiss Alps. but nothing, and I mean nothing, could\u2019ve prepared us for that mysterious beach.\nthe sun was swallowed by the horizon, and the sands under our feet had cooled down. we set up camp for the night right at the edge of the beach, where the vegetation began. 'Saumy', I called out, 'Do you feel it too?' she looked at me, her eyes wide with astonishment. before we could react, the figure disappeared, illuminating a path deeper into the forest.\n, 'Saumy...wake up,' I whispered, shaking her gently. Saumy stirred, blinking sleepily at me before her eyes widened in realization. we watched as the figure finally came to a halt in front of a cave lined with gleaming crystals of various colors.
