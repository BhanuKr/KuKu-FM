  "body": "We huddled in the shadows, the stone walls of the palace cold and unyielding against our backs. My heart pounded in my chest like a war drum, each beat a deafening echo of our impending doom. Saumy sat beside me, her small frame fragile yet resolute. Her eyes, usually chipper, glittered with a solemn determination. 'We need a new plan,' she said, breaking the heavy silence. Her voice was weak, but it carried a weight, a gravity that was difficult to ignore.\n\nA new plan. Easier said than done. But we had no time to waste. I nodded, pushing my brain into high gear. Every minute we spent here, every breath we drew was a gamble, a challenge to fate. And we were running out of time. Mordor's next attack on Panchala was imminent; we had overheard the king's vile plans. And as much as the thought of it sent chills down my spine, I knew it was now or never.\n\nWe worked through the night, formulating a plan, improvising, adjusting. Saumy suggested we rally the common people. I agreed, but with a slight modification. Instead of inciting a full-on rebellion, which would have resulted in countless casualties, we would rally the unseen - the palace's scullery maids, the gardeners, the stable boys, the foot soldiers. Those who lived in the shadows, unnoticed and unappreciated. Those who, like us, had much to gain and little to lose.\n\nThe following days were a blur of frantic preparation. We laid low by day, blending with the other servants. By night, we became whispering shadows, spreading word of our impending rebellion. As the sun set on the eve of the attack on Panchala, we were ready. Our tiny army, the unseen, had become a simmering pot, ready to boil over. And I, Bhanu, a mere villager from Panchala, was leading them.\n\nUnder the cloak of night, we struck. The palace was plunged into chaos. Confused, disoriented guards were no match for our well-coordinated attack. We navigated the labyrinthine palace, striking down anyone who posed a threat. But the king... The king was nowhere to be found.\n\nJust as despair threatened to consume me, Saumy, pale and exhausted but glowing with a fiery defiance, pointed up. There, atop the highest tower, silhouetted against the moon, stood the king. Surrounded by his personal guard, he looked down on us, a sneer marring his face. 'We need to get up there,' I told Saumy, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nDefying the odds, we made our way through the palace, to the tower. And as we climbed the spiral staircase, as the moonlit silhouette of the king loomed closer, I felt a chill run down my spine. For Panchala, for Saumy, I had to do this. It was now or never.",

  "summary_till_now": "Bhanu, a simple villager from the Himalayan hamlet of Panchala, recounts the devastating invasion of his peaceful village by the kingdom of Mordor. The attack reduces their homes to rubble and leaves Bhanu and his younger sister, Saumy, as the only survivors. Driven by the need to prevent future attacks and restore peace, Bhanu decides that they must take control of Mordor's palace, a formidable fortress. Armed with courage and an old map, they embark on a treacherous journey through dense forests and steep slopes. Despite their fears and the palpable reminder of their lost family, their determination keeps them going.\n\nUpon reaching the palace, they devise a plan to infiltrate it. Saumy, armed with a sling, is to distract the guards while Bhanu sneaks in. As their plan is set into motion, Bhanu is spotted just as he nears the top of the wall. Amidst the ensuing chaos, he hears a scream and sees Saumy falling, leaving the tale on a tragic cliffhanger.\nThe protagonist's sister, Saumy, falls into a pit, resulting in a terrifying scream that alerts the guards.

Despite the impending danger, the protagonist decides to confront the king, but first, he must find Saumy. He discovers Saumy alive, albeit injured, which fills him with hope. They reconcile and resolve to confront the challenges ahead: saving their home, dethroning a tyrant king, and bracing themselves for the potential wrath of an entire kingdom.\nIn the palace's cold stone shadows, the protagonist and their companion Saumy anxiously realize they need a new plan to thwart the impending attack on Panchala by Mordor. Despite the daunting task, they work tirelessly, deciding to rally the palace's overlooked servants for a covert rebellion.
