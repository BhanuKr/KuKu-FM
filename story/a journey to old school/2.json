  "body": "Bhanu's trembling and Saumy's pounding heart prevailed under the deafening echo of the chilling voice, 'You shouldn't have come back.' The room, bathed in an eerie darkness, quaked with an unknown terror, and the haunting melody of the gramophone filled the silence.\n\n'Saumy...' Bhanu stuttered, gripping his friend's arm, eyes darting about in the darkness. 'Remember Mukesh?'\n\nSaumy swallowed hard, staring into the abyss. The name sent a disconcerting shiver coursing through his spine. 'Mukesh...' He echoed, his voice barely a whisper. Mukesh was their classmate, a mischievous boy who died in a tragic accident on the school premises years ago. Rumors of his ghost haunting the school spread among the students, but they never gave it much thought. But the terror they felt now, and the voice... Could it be?\n\nSuddenly, the room was filled with an ethereal light. The source was an old photograph of their class, lying on a dusty table, showing a young, grinning Mukesh. Saumy and Bhanu exchanged a terrified look. They should have respected the rumors. They should have respected Mukesh's memory.\n\nWith a surge of courage, Bhanu stepped forward, looking at the photograph. 'Mukesh, it's us, Bhanu and Saumy,' he spoke into the dimly lit room. 'We didn't mean to disrespect you. We are sorry.'\n\nFor a moment, everything was silent. Then, a gust of wind made the photograph flit around the room before falling at Bhanu's feet. A soft voice echoed, 'You are forgiven.' The gramophone went dead, the shadows vanished, and the door creaked open to the light outside.\n\nBoth of them let out a shared sigh of relief before calmly walking out of the room and back into the sunlit school compound. The reunion had taken a terrifying turn that they would remember for the rest of their lives. A simple alumni meet had turned into a horrifying reminder of their childhood transgressions and the memories of a friend they had forgotten to honor.\n\nBack home, they vowed to return to their school every year, not for a reunion, but to honor Mukesh's memory. The horrifying night had not only strengthened their bond but also taught them a valuable lesson about respect and forgiveness.\n\nAs they sat under the same tree, reliving the fateful night, an owl hooted in the distance. It was dusk, and the school building looked peaceful as the setting sun cast long, crimson shadows against it. Bhanu and Saumy exchanged comfortable smiles, their hearts filled with forgiveness and respect for the past. They knew they were at peace with the friendly ghost now. A chapter was finally closed, and the school no longer held any haunting memories for them.",

  "summary_till_now": "After many years apart, childhood friends Saumy and Bhanu return to their old school in Uttar Pradesh for an alumni meet. Reuniting under the same tree where they used to learn, they are both filled with nostalgia, though Bhanu also feels a sense of fear. During the reunion, a loud crash from the school building interrupts the joyful atmosphere. Despite Bhanu's dread, Saumy's curiosity leads them to investigate. Inside the eerily silent building, uncanny events occur, including a locker door flying open, a gramophone playing a haunting melody, furniture shaking, and shadows moving on their own. As they try to escape, the door mysteriously locks, trapping them inside. A chilling voice whispers that they shouldn't have come back, leaving them in a room filled with haunting sounds and their own palpable fear.\nIn a chilling encounter, old school friends Bhanu and Saumy are confronted by a spectral voice during a reunion at their alma mater. The voice reminds them of Mukesh, a mischievous classmate who tragically died on the school premises years back, triggering rumors of his ghost haunting the school. As they stand in a room shrouded in darkness and fear, an old photograph of Mukesh eerily illuminates, compelling the friends to confront their past disregard for the rumors and Mukesh's memory. Gathering his courage, Bhanu apologizes to Mukesh for their past disrespect, eliciting a gust of wind that moves the photo and a soft voice that forgives them. The terrifying experience transforms their reunion into an unforgettable lesson about respect and forgiveness. As a result, Bhanu and Saumy pledge to annually honor Mukesh's memory at their school. The encounter leaves them at peace with their past and Mukesh's ghost, replacing haunting memories of their school with feelings of forgiveness and respect."
