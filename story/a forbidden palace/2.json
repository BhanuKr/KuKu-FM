FORBIDDEN PALACE - NIGHT\n\nAfter laughing heartily, Bhanu notices Vansh unconscious and rushes to his side, leaving the ghost chuckling by himself.\n\nBHANU: \n(panicked)\nVansh, wake up dude!\n\nSuddenly, the GHOST glides over, ghostly face twisting into a concerned look. He waves his ghostly hand over Vansh's face who wakes up with a gasp, looking terrified.\n\nVANSH: \n(screams)\nWhy is it still here?!!\n\nBHANU: \n(laughs)\nOh relax, buddy! He's a friendly ghost!\n\nGhost nods, grinning ear-to-ear which frightens Vansh further. Then Vansh notices the GHOST doesn't have ears. He faints again.\n\nBHANU: \n(sighs)\nOkay, we need to sort this out.\n\nSuddenly, a BUTLER GHOST appears, carrying a tray with cups of ghostly tea.\n\nBUTLER GHOST: \n(polite)\nTea, sirs?\n\nBHANU: \n(surprised)\nGhost tea? Sure!\n\nBhanu grabs a cup and takes a sip. His face contorts into confusion as he tries to swallow the spectral beverage. Vansh wakes up again, sees the Butler Ghost and faints immediately.\n\nBHANU: \n(to Ghost)\nWe should get him out of here. Can you help?\n\nThe ghost waves his hand, and suddenly, Vansh stops fainting. He wakes up, looking less scared.\n\nVANSH: \n(confused)\nWait, I'm not scared...why am I not scared?\n\nBHANU: \n(laughs)\nGhost dude here fixed you! You won't faint anymore. As long as we're in the palace.\n\nVANSH: \n(relieved)\nOh...uh, thanks, I guess...\n\nThings get even stranger when the ghostly palace suddenly transforms into a spectral disco, complete with a neon dance floor. Ghostly figures start pouring in, grooving to funky ethereal beats.\n\nBHANU: \n(excited)\nHey, Vansh! Let's hit the dance floor!\n\nVANSH: \n(nervous)\nI...uh...I can't dance...\n\nBHANU: \n(grinning)\nNot a problem, dude. Watch this.\n\nBhanu takes a step onto the dance floor. Suddenly, he starts moving like a pro-dancer. It's like the dance floor itself is teaching him!\n\nVANSH: \n(astonished)\nThe floor...you're...I mean...it's...\n\nBHANU: \n(laughing)\nCome on, Vansh!\n\nReluctantly, Vansh steps onto the dance floor and soon, he too is moving like a champion. Both Bhanu and Vansh dance, laugh, and have a blast with their new ghostly friends. Just when things couldn't get more ridiculous, a conga line forms, led by the Butler Ghost.\n\nSuddenly, a loud bell starts tolling, shocking everyone. The music stops. The GHOST, looking serious, floats towards the main hall. Vansh and Bhanu, now completely engrossed in this strange world, follow him. They enter the main hall to see a large, ancient ghost sitting on a throne.\n\nThe throne ghost, THE ANCIENT ONE, glaring at Vansh and Bhanu, booms out a question.\n\nANCIENT ONE: \n(ominous)\nWhy are you here, mortals?!\n\nVansh looks at Bhanu, fear creeping back into his eyes. As they stand before the formidable Ancient One, a heavy silence descends on the hall.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...\n",
