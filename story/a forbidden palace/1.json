THE FORBIDDEN PALACE - NIGHT\n\nVANSH (20s, well-dressed, scaredy-cat) and BHANU (20s, adventurous, reassuring), two best friends, stand before the mammoth and eerie FORBIDDEN PALACE, a NO TRESPASSING sign swinging ominously in the wind.\n\nBHANU\n(smirking)\nCome on, Vansh. It's just a creepy, old building.\n\nVANSH\n(stammering)\nB-B-But it's forbidden, Bhanu. F-O-R-B-I-D-D-E-N.\n\nBHANU\n(chuckles)\nThat makes it all the more enticing, buddy.\n\nBhanu marches forward while Vansh follows, clutching his bag to his chest. They push open the creaky, wooden doors and step into a grand HALLWAY filled with dust-covered antiques and faded portraits.\n\nSuddenly, a GUST OF WIND blows out their torches. Vansh screams. Bhanu laughs.\n\nBHANU\n(looking at Vansh)\nScared much?\n\nVANSH\n(nervously)\nSays the guy who laughed when the wind blew...normal guy thing to do...\n\nSuddenly, a wailing sound fills the air. Vansh looks terrified. Bhanu looks intrigued.\n\nBHANU\n(reassuring)\nIt's just the wind, Vansh. Relax.\n\nBut then, the sound of FOOTSTEPS. Slow. Heavy. Echoing.\n\nVANSH\n(real scared)\nIs wind wearing boots now, Bhanu?\n\nSuddenly, an ANTIQUE VASE spontaneously shatters. Vansh yells and hides behind Bhanu.\n\nBHANU\n(laughs)\nMaybe it's a...ghost!\n\nVansh gives a nervous chuckle. Suddenly, a spectacular GHOST (30s, mischievous, translucent), dressed in ancient regalia, materializes before them.\n\nVANSH\n(screaming)\nA REAL GHOST!\n\nGHOST\n(smirks)\nYou expected a fake one?\n\nBhanu bursts out laughing while Vansh faints, causing the Ghost to laugh as well.\n\nGHOST\n(to Bhanu)\nWhat's with him? Accidentally step on a lego brick?\n\nBHANU\n(smiling)\nNo, he just met a ghost for the first time.\n\nThe Ghost chuckles. Meanwhile, Vansh stirs, gets up, takes one look at the Ghost, and faints again. Bhanu and the Ghost high-five.\n\nFADE OUT: TO BE CONTINUED...",
